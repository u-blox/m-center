* Synopsis:     powerMng_saraR5_lpwaFirstConfigurationPwrOff_advanced.atl
* Topic:        power_management
* Version:      1.0
* Author:       pwar
* Description:
*       This script has the purpose to configure the cellular device after 
*       cold booting. This script waits for registration and then configures
*       +UPSV. It turns off Auto-Bauding and sets the greeting message.
*       The greeting message is used for the publish script to know when the 
*       module has been turned on.
*       This script uses the DTR line to control the deep sleep of the module.
*
*       The wake-up and publish script choices are:
*       Steps: Turn On, Connect, Publish message, wait for ACK, Pwr_off
*       powerMng_saraR5_lpwa_wake_up_and_publish_QoS1Pwr_off_advanced.atl
*           or
*       Steps: Turn on, Publish message, Pwr_off
*       powerMng_saraR5_lpwa_wake_up_and_publish_QoS-1Pwr_off_advanced.atl
